## Full Signature Aggregation

- same size as one sig
    - 26.1% bytes, 9.6% weight units average btc tx
    - https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/cross-input-aggregation/blob/master/savings.org
- interactivity

### Applications

- Block-wide signature aggregation
    - Probably not feasible
    - Can be combined with half-agg on block level
- Tx-wide signature aggregation
    -
- Gossip protocol bandwidth savings in Layer-2 protocols
